# Delivery Market Analysis With SQL

##  Description
The Delivery Market Analysis project aims to explore trends, customer preferences, 
and market dynamics in the food delivery space in Belgium. We have been tasked with analyzing 
databases provided by a consultant to uncover actionable insights for restaurant partners and consumers.

## ðŸ“Š Overview to the project
Access to meals has been redefined, with unparalleled convenience and diverse dining options now at our fingertips. This project explores food delivery platforms in Belgium, offering valuable insights:
Consumer Preferences: Highlighting top-rated restaurants across key food categories to help users make informed dining choices.
Platform Comparisons: Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each platform, including pricing, delivery costs, and the relationship between price and ratings.
Regional Trends: Investigating patterns in cities and regions across Belgium to identify service gaps and local preferences.
By delivering a comprehensive overview of these platforms, this analysis aims to enhance the food delivery experience, making it more tailored and user-friendly. Whether you're comparing platforms or exploring market trends, this project simplifies navigating Belgium's food delivery landscape.
